# AI-Powered Multi-Airline Policy Assistant

## Problem & Solution

**Problem**: Travelers waste significant time navigating complex airline websites to find specific policy information, often encountering inconsistent or outdated data across multiple airline platforms.

**Solution**: Our AI-powered assistant eliminates the confusion by providing instant, accurate answers to airline policy questions through natural language queries. The system automatically scrapes and maintains up-to-date policy data from multiple airlines, then uses advanced semantic search to deliver precise, contextual responses with multilingual support including voice interaction capabilities.

### **A Quick Tour of the Application**

This intelligent RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system streamlines the process of finding airline policy information. Here's a quick look at the user experience from start to finish.

**1. The Main Interface:** Simply select an airline and type your question in natural language or use voice input.

**2. The Backend in Action:** The system instantly connects to the API and processes your request with optional text-to-speech output.

**3. The Final Result:** Receive an instant, accurate, and sourced response to your query.

**4. Speak System:** Ask your question via recording.
